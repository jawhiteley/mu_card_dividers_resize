```{=latex}
% original resolution was 150 dpi, but I'm using slightly higher to shrink full-sized images to fit on the page with the code statements
% (I care about color, not resolution, but I want things to be the same size / resolution, despite different pixel sizes)

\pdfpxdimen=1in    
\divide\pdfpxdimen by 200

% automatically insert a page break after each graphic, so the following code echo appears above the corresponding image

\let\includegraphicsOG\includegraphics
\renewcommand{\includegraphics}[2][]{%
  \includegraphicsOG[#1]{#2}
  \pagebreak
}
```

Based on output from `Experiments with pdf files and images.r`

Original file was produced in Photoshop, with 1 image per page, and the "Adobe RGB (1998)" icc profile embedded in the pdf (for the entire document).
What impact does an embedded profile have on display in a LaTeX pdf file?

Can I specify an icc profile for 1 or more images in a pdf file (without converting or altering pixel values), to recover or preserve the icc profile from the original?

## Test Images

```{r out.height = paste0(1200/200, "in")}
# Exported from Preview with Adobe icc profile (1 frame per page)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/mu_card_dividers_v2 (Preview-Adobe).png"))

# Above, read into R magick, and re-exported after being trimmed (native resolution and Adobe icc profile)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/test-png.png"))

# Exported from Preview with Adobe icc profile (1 frame per page), sRGB profile assigned (colours appear washed out in Preview)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/mu_card_dividers_v2 (Preview-Adobe+sRGB).png"))

# Extracted with pdfimages (no icc profile)
