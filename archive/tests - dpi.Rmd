% Set ppi for entire document: 1 pixel = 1/150 in, or 150 ppi
% https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5041492/latex-how-to-set-the-pdf-dpi-when-using-images
% Changes the definition of a 'pixel' for all measurements, but at least it's consistent, and seems to work with R Markdown.
% Might be specific to pdf engine (pdftex vs pdflatex?)

\pdfpxdimen=1in    
\divide\pdfpxdimen by 150

% I expected this to work, but I get an error "! Dimension too large" :(

    \setlength{\pdfpxdimen}{1in/150}


```{=latex}
% Change dpi of images only? Using `pdftex` primitive
% seems to have no effect, even in the preamble ('header-includes')

\pdfimageresolution=150

% Custom macro - no effect :(

\newcommand{\includegraphicsdpi}[3]{%
    \pdfimageresolution=#1  % Change the dpi of images
    \includegraphics[#2]{#3}
    \pdfimageresolution=72  % Change it back to the default
}
```

## Test Images
```{r}
# 'native' resolution of the file is 72 ppi, but original (and intended) is 150 ppi.
# png file include both dpi (72) and pHYs chunk (2834 px / m = 150 ppi?)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/img-000-pdfimages.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "1500px" }
# setting out.width to knwon # pixels (depends on document dpi)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/img-000-pdfimages.png"))
```

```{r out.width = paste0(1500/150, "in") }
# setting out.width to inches explicitly, based on known # pixels and desired dpi (150)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/img-000-pdfimages.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "100%" }
# setting out.width to 100%
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/img-000-pdfimages.png"))
```

```{r}
# 'native' resolution of this file is 150x150
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/tests/test-png.png"))
```


```{r}
# individual divider in 'native' or default resolution (72x72?)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/div-001.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "541 px" }
# setting out.width to known # pixels (depends on document dpi, default is 72)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/div-001.png"))
```

```{r out.width = paste0(541/150, "in") }
# setting out.width to inches explicitly, based on known # pixels and desired dpi (150)
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/div-001.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "100%" }
# setting out.width to 100%
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/div-001.png"))
```

Using custom macro and `pdftex` primitive (nope):

\includegraphicsdpi{150}{}{div-001.png}
