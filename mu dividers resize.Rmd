% PARAMETERS: Dimensions (inherited from document parameters: `params` R object)

\def\DivHeight{`r params$div_height`mm}     % Height of each divider
\setlength{\fboxrule}{`r params$border_width`mm}  % width of border around each divider
\setlength{\fboxsep}{-0\fboxrule}    % space separating border from contents (set to 0 for a tight border)

% re-define \includegraphics command to set desired size and border: 
%  the image will be automatically sized to fit the width, flush with the top-left
%  aspect ratio is preserved by default, but can be forced with the `keepaspectratio` option in \includegraphics (graphicx package), if necessary
% To align dividers vertically on a line, [pos] must not  = [contentpos].  
%  I want the image top-aligned within the box, and the box borders aligned, ideally also along the top, but since they are all the same height, 'bottom' works, too (and is different from 'top').
\newcommand*{\divbox}[1]{\fcolorbox{`r border_colour`}{white}{%
  \parbox[b][\DivHeight][t]{\DivWidth}{%
    \rule{0pt}{0pt}#1
    % not too sure why the \rule with 0 width and height works, 
    % but having *something* inside the parbox ensures it is the correct size, even if otherwise 'empty'

% Set the inter-word spacing to the same as the border width, but negative, so that they overlap.
