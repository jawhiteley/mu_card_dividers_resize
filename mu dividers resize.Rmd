# If you want to do everything here in one step, set the value of the 'extract_images' parameter to 'TRUE' in the in the document header.
# If you already ran the r script and want to skip directly to output, set the value of the 'extract_images' parameter to 'FALSE' in the in the document header.

# Run the external script to extract graphics from the input pdf.
# All the necessary parameters are set in that script. 
# This document does not rely on running this script during compilation, in case you want to run the script first, then produce the output in 2 steps (see comments above).
# Running the external script here just allows you to do it all in one step.

% LaTeX setup - some of this could go in the (YAML) header (header-includes), but there's quite a bit, and this works.

% PARAMETERS: Dimensions (inherited from document parameters: `params` R object)
\def\DivWidth{`r params$div_width`mm}       % Width of each divider
\def\DivHeight{`r params$div_height`mm}     % Height of each divider
\setlength{\fboxrule}{`r params$border_width`mm}  % width of border around each divider
\setlength{\fboxsep}{0mm}    % space separating border from contents (set to 0 for a tight border)

% re-define \includegraphics command to set desired size and border: the image will be automatically sized to fit the width, flush with the top-left (aspect ratio is preserved by default)
\let\includegraphicsOG\includegraphics
\renewcommand*{\includegraphics}[2][]{\fcolorbox{`r params$border_colour`}{white}{\parbox[t][\DivHeight]{\DivWidth}{\includegraphicsOG[#1]{#2}}}}

% control spacing around graphics
\setlength{\lineskip}{-\fboxrule}   % remove veritcal space between dividers (negative width of the border, so borders from adjacent lines overlap)

\raggedright    % force left alignment (aka 'raggedright') instead of fully justified
% Set the inter-word spacing to the same as the border width, but negative, so that they overlap.
%   For whatever reason, line and page breaks still work fine. 
%   Alternatively, these lengths can be set very small, and `\hspace{-\fboxrule}` added to the end of the \includegraphics re-definition above.
\setlength{\spaceskip}{-\fboxrule}
%\setlength{\xspaceskip}{-\fboxrule}

```{r output, echo=FALSE}
# get list of (png) files: 1 file per divider

# loop over the list and apply include_graphics() (vectorized!), which should use the custom command defined above.
