## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Test Images

```{r, out.width = "9.2cm", echo=FALSE}
image_border(test_div, "black", "1x1")
```
```{r, out.width = "9.2cm", out.height = "9cm", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(paste0(base_path, "/div-001.png"))

image_read(paste0(base_path, "/div-001.png")) %>%
  image_border("black", "1x1")
```
```{r, out.height = "9cm", echo=FALSE}
image_border(test_div, "black", "1x1")
```

- - -
```{r, fig.width = (9.2 / cm(1)), fig.height = (7 / cm(1)), out.width = "9.2cm", echo=FALSE}
# fig.width & fig.height only really apply to R-generated graphics (plots), not external graphics files (png)
# out.width OR out.height do affect the size of both (fig.asp can be used to change the aspect ratio; fig.height = fig.width * fig.asp)
image_border(test_div, "black", "1x1")
```
```{r, fig=T, out.extra='height=9cm, width=9.2cm', echo=FALSE}
# keepaspectratio = true by default: \includegraphics will not distort pictures if both height and width are specified, instead the image is scaled so that neither dimensions exceeds the specified dimensions.
image_border(test_div, "black", "1x1")
```
```{r, fig=T, out.extra='height=9cm, width=9.2cm, keepaspectratio=false', echo=FALSE}
# keepaspectratio = false: now the height and width are respected, and the image is distorted.
image_border(test_div, "black", "1x1")
```

\La\TeX

```{=latex}

\includegraphics{div-001.png} % native size? Or just full textwidth

% https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/282994/why-is-fbox-leaving-padding-on-the-left-and-right-of-my-includegraphics
\setlength{\fboxsep}{0cm}    % still some horizontal white space?  Check white space around the contents (new lines)
\setlength{\fboxrule}{1pt}

\fbox{%

% using 'frame' option to \includegraphics (adjustbox package)
% https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/349918/image-frame-borders-in-pdf-from-latex-template-with-pandoc-markdown
% suggests I could create a custom version of the \includegraphics command in the YAML header, which would be applied for every include_graphics() command in an R chunk ...
\fbox{%
  \parbox[t][7cm]{8cm}{%
    \includegraphics[frame, width=9.2cm]{div-001.png}%
  }%

  }%
}
% any empty lines between boxes will put graphics on a new line in the output. ;)
\fbox{%
  \parbox[t]{9cm}{%
    \includegraphics[trim=0 4cm 0 0, clip]{div-001.png}% image is resized to fit _width_, box appears to resize to accommodate _height_
  }%
}

% what a mess.  I clearly do not understand the viewport argument:
\fbox{%
  \includegraphics[frame, width=9.2cm, totalheight=7cm, viewport=0 0.4cm 9cm 9cm, clip]{div-001.png}%
}

% Can I get images to wrap cleanly: no clipping off the page, line breaks where appropriate, with no space between images?
%  \- hypenation?
%  \figure environment - I think this creates 'floats', which is not quite what I want; I think I prefer inline boxes that I can stack together.
% Based on examination of .tcx outpute from Rmarkdown, R code that includes an external file is always converted to an \includegraphics statement (using the graphicx package).
