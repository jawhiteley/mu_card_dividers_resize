# TEMPLATE

Modular code for processing a specific set of files.

```{r modular-setup}
pdf_file <- "mu_x-men_horiz_dividers_legion.pdf"
unlockBinding("params", env = .GlobalEnv)  # `params` in knitr is usually locked during rendering.
params$extract_images <- TRUE
lockBinding("params", env = .GlobalEnv)  # lock `params` again.

```

A [R]Markdown file is easier to edit when there are more notes than code.

```{r modular-processing}
img_files <- img_files[c(1:3, 3:1)]
page_breaks <- 2
```
